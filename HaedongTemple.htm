		<p>Haedong Yonggung Temple is a Buddhist temple built in 1376, by a teacher named Naong during the Goryeo Dynasty. It is on the east side of Busan and is one of the few temples in Korea that overlooks the sea.</p>
		
		<p>During Buddha's Birthday, celebrations are held at the temple, making the beginning of May a popular time to visit Busan. Many people also visit the temple during the Spring to see the blooming of cherry blossoms, a beautiful sight to behold in Korea. The temple is also a popular spot to visit during New Year's Day when people come to make wishes as they watch the sun rise for the first time in the new year.</p>
		
		<p>Haedong Yonggung Temple operates from 4am to 7pm. There is no admission fee, but there is a fee for using the temple's parking facilities.</p>
