		<p>Haeundae Beach was named by the scholar Choi Chi-Won of the Silla Kingdom, after he carved the words <em>"Hae Un Dae"</em> on a stone wall. Haeundae Beach runs 1.5 kilometers long and between 30 and 50 kilometers wide.</p>
		
		<p>Haeundae Beach is known for the many festivals and cultural events that are held there throughout the year. Nearby there is a folk square where travelers can watch or participate in various traditional Korean games and sports. In addition to the folk square, there is also the Beach Culture Center and the Beach Library for people who are seeking to learn even more about the culture of Busan.</p>
		
		<p>Haeundae Beach is open between June 1st and September 10th each year. During that time period the beach is open 24 hours every day. If you plan on visiting Korea in the summer, visiting Haeundae Beach is an opportunity that shouldn't be missed!</p>
