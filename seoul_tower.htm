		<p>Originally used only for telecommunication purposes, Seoul Tower opened to the public in 1980. While still known by many as the Seoul Tower, the tower was renamed in 2005 to 'N Seoul Tower' to signify the completion of a successful remodeling project. Seoul Tower stands 236.7 meters tall with the base of the tower 243 meters atop Namson Mountain, making the top of Seoul Tower the highest point in Seoul.</p>
		
		<p>The main attraction of Seoul Tower is the Observatory that offers a one-of-a-kind panoramic view of the entire city of Seoul. However, that is not the only reason to visit the structure. There is also a variety of gift-shops and restaurants, including a restaurant that actually revolves around the tower itself. There is also the Alive Museum that features paintings and other traditional pieces of artwork mixed with optical illusions and interactive art.</p>
		
		<p>Seoul Tower is open year round with the Observatory being open every day from 10am to 11pm.</p>
