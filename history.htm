		<p>The Korean Peninsula has been populated for over half a million years. The first ancient kingdom in Korea, as described in Korean mythology, was the Gojoseon kingdom founded in 2333 BC. Being close in proximity to the seafaring nations of China and Japan, the history of Korea is intertwined with the history of those two countries. For a period of time Korea was ruled by three separate kingdoms until they were unified in 676. The unification of the three kingdoms allowed art, poetry and Buddhist culture to thrive in Korea.</p>

		<p>In the 15th century, the renowned King Sejong the Great created the writing system Hangeul which led to increased literacy throughout the land. King Sejong's rule also led to advances in technology and education as well as the introduction of Confucianism to the culture of Korea.</p>
		
		<p>In the years to come, Korea would find itself the victim of Japanese imperialism and would spend centuries trying to protect and preserve its own culture and independence</p>
		
		<p>Fast forward to the 20th century, after the Korean war. Korea saw a period of rapid industrialization and economic growth thanks in part to the assistance of the developed country, the United States of America. This period of growth is affectionately known as the "Miracle on the Han River." As of 2014, South Korea has the 13th largest economy in the world based on nominal GDP (International Monetary Fund + World Bank rankings). Korea is also a leading nation in information technology, education, and healthcare.</p>
		
		<p>Immigration to Korea is on the rise based on the international popularity of Korean pop culture which has spread rapidly in a cultural phenomenon known as the "Korean Wave".</p>
		
		<p> With a rich history and a bright future, it is no wonder that so many people want to experience Korea for themselves!</p>
