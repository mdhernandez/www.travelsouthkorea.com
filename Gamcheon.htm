		<p> Gamcheon was once one of Busan's most poverty-stricken areas, but the village has changed dramatically since then with the help of government funding and creativity from inhabitants. The area is now known for its painted houses, intricate alleyways, street murals, and artistic charm.</p>
		
		<p>There are many interesting facilities available inside the village such as pottery and textile workshops, cafes, museums, restaurants, art shops, and more! </p>
		
		<p>Gamcheon Culture Village is open year-round with most of its facilities operating between 9am and 6pm. Guided tours are offered in a variety of languages including English, Chinese, and Japanese.</p>
